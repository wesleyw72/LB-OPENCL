#  OpenCL Lattice Boltzmann

An OpenCL optimisation of a Lattice Boltzmann scheme.
* 2D grid
* 9 velocities per grid cell.
* Using Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook collision step

Based on an unoptimised version provided by the UoB-HPC team [Here](https://github.com/UoB-HPC/UoB-HPC-LBM-2016).

## Report
A report and explanation of the optimisation is available upon request.
